Reddit Sneaker Bot - Botting and Data Science in Python

Originally created in Winter 2020

• A web-based bot created using an API to read user posts on Reddit and answer queries about the identification of an image of a sneaker

• Takes images of sneakers and uses Google reverse image search to find information on the shoes

• Also determines likelihood of the resulting identification of the sneaker being true
